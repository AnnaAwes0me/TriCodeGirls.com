<H3> What is Cyberstart? </H3>
<p> 
Cyberstart is a national coding competition where teams of highschool<BR> 
girls must beat a variety of challenges emphasizing hacking, programming,<BR>
and cybersecurity. Throughout the duration of the competition, girls<BR> 
will learn a variety of skills including python, binary, password<BR>
cracking, and encryption. You can view their site <a href= "https://girlsgocyberstart.org/">here</a>
</p>
<H3> How does it work? </H3>
<p>
The competition consists of 3 rounds: Assess, Game, and Compete, each <BR>
with a different level of difficulty and number of challenges. Starting<BR>
with Assess, team members must beat 5 of 15 challenges to qualify for<BR>
the next round. The next level, Game consists of 3 bases, each base<BR>
containing levels and challenges for each student to try their hand<BR>
at. Following Game, teams are selected to take part in Compete.<BR>
during which teams are given only 1 to 3 days to complete<BR> 
challenges in a capture-the-flag style competition.<BR>
