<h1>Welcome to Tricode Girls!</h1>

<BR>
<h3> What is Tricode girls? </h3>
<p>
Tricode girls is a coding club centered on teaching and supporting girls of all ages,<BR> 
all ethnicities, and all backgrounds. Girls will build skills in cybersecurity,<BR>
computer science, and programming. Our club is and always will be completely free. <BR>
Tricode girls club has classes in two age groups; <a href="/middleschool.html">Middle School</a> and <a href="/highschool.html">High-school</a>,<BR>
the main difference being the High school group will include training for the girls<BR>
who choose to participate in the <a href="/tricodegirls.php?page=cyberstart">Girls Go Cyberstart</a> competition team.<BR>

<h3>Our Founder</h3>
<p> 
Anna Lorberblatt is a student at Western Carolina University where she is working <BR>
towards a dual major in environmental science and computer programming. Outside of <BR>
school, she enjoys reading, writing, camping, and spending time with her friends.<BR>
Anna frequently volunteers through various organizations and in a special needs <BR>
ministry. She works to encourage and empower women in STEM and looks forward<BR>
to a future where computer science isn’t considered a “man’s field.”<BR>

<h3> Our Story</h3>
<p>
When I entered the first Girls Go Cyberstart competition in 2017 I wasn’t expecting<BR>
to do anything radical. I was reluctant to form a team, and I had no great belief<BR>
in our competitive ability. I couldn’t have been more wrong. I will always<BR>
remember the day when the first scores went up. I was with my team between<BR>
classes and an adult brought us the news that we were in 11th place in our state,<BR> 
out of hundreds. The shock and excitement of our placing that day quickly turned<BR>
into a competitive zeal that drove us to take 4th in state and 39th nationally.<BR> 
Out of that spirit the first idea for the club was born.<BR>
                                                                        <BR><img src= "/images/disassembled-computer.jpg" alt= "Anna-head-shot" width="255" height="325" align="right">
At first, the new coding club was open to anyone who wanted to join.<BR>
However my expectation of equal interest quickly proved wrong as parent<BR>
after parent told me about their son’s interest in the field. One particular<BR>
incident stood out to me. I spoke to a mother who was overseeing a Girl Scout<BR>
cookie stand and told her about my club. Even standing with her two daughters,<BR>
all she said was that her son was too young to join, but might be interested,<BR> 
later. The idea of coding as a men’s field is so ingrained in our culture<BR>
that women aren’t even a part of the equation. I realized after that encounter<BR>
that I would have to force the issue. I made the club exclusive to girls.<BR>
                                                                    <BR>
From there things took off. It was important to me that money would<BR>
not be a barrier to anyone, so we made Tri Code Girls free to join.<BR>
We asked people to send us their old and broken computers so we could<BR>
fix them and created a library of laptops. To fund our first ventures<BR>
we became an official branch of Girls Who Code. As our numbers grew we<BR>
met many different places, until my family moved into a larger house<BR>
and we began to meet there. We’ve put together a team for the Girls Go<BR>
Cyberstart competition every year since 2017t, receiving recognition<BR>
from the Governor of North Carolina and other parties. Despite many<BR>
different honors I could cite, the moment where I finally realized<BR>
the impact of the club I started was on a normal day. When the club<BR>
was learning some basic Python programming. I sat down to help two<BR>
girls who had never touched a computer before. It took me a minute<BR>
to realize how large the gap was and I began showing them how to use<BR>
a mouse and keyboard, how to click and drag. Skills I had taken for<BR>
granted. To me, we were teaching basic coding concepts. To them,<BR>
they were getting their first opportunity to use computers at all.<BR>
In that moment I saw just how radical what we have set out to do truly is<BR>
