<h1>Welcome to TriCode Girls!</h1>

<BR>
<h3> What is Tricode girls? </h3>
Tricode girls is a coding club centered on teaching and supporting girls of all ages, all ethnicities,<BR>
and all backgrounds. Girls will build skills in cybersecurity, computer science, and programming.<BR><img src= "/images/my-fav-anna.jpg" alt= "Anna-head-shot" width="255" height="325" align="right">
Our club is and always will be completely free. We believe that money should not be the object that stands<BR>
between a girl and her interests or dreams. Tricode girls club has classes in two age groups; <a href="www.tricodegirls/middleschool.com">Middle School</a> <BR>
and <a href="www.tricodegirls/highschool.com">High-school</a>,  the main difference being the High school group will include training for the girls<BR>
who choose to participate in the <a href="/tricodegirls.php?page=cyberstart">Girls Go Cyberstart</a> competition team.<BR>
