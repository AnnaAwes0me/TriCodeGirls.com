<h1>Welcome to TriCode Girls!</h1>

<BR>
<h3> What is Tricode girls? </h3>
Tricode girls is a coding club centered on teaching and supporting girls of all ages,<BR> 
all ethnicities, and all backgrounds. Girls will build skills in cybersecurity,<BR>
computer science, and programming. Our club is and always will be completely free. <BR>
We believe that money should not be the object that stands between a girl and her<BR> 
interests or dreams. Tricode girls club has classes in two age groups; <a href="/middleschool.html">Middle School</a> <BR>
and <a href="/highschool.html">High-school</a>,  the main difference being the High school group will include training for the<BR>
girls who choose to participate in the <a href="/tricodegirls.php?page=cyberstart">Girls Go Cyberstart</a> competition team.<BR>
