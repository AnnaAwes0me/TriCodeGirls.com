			<h4>Who are we?</h4>
			<p>We are a Raleigh-Native <a href="www.girlswhocode.com">Girls Who Code</a> chapter operating out of Generation's homeschool group. We have both a <a href="www.tricodegirls/highschool.com">Highschool</a> oriented group and a <a href="www.tricodegirls/middleschool.com">Middle School</a> and younger group. Our goal is to serve the community right here at home by introducing girls to coding concepts early on.</p>
