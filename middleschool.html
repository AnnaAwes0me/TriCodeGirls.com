During the course of Tricode girls club middle school girls will work<BR>
and learn together as we explore lessons in cryptography, programming,<BR>
web design, and hacking. Tricode girls also offers a small library of<BR>
books on coding or famous historical women in STEM. We also have some<BR>
“library computers” that we loan out to girls who don’t have a computer<BR>
to use for class<BR>
