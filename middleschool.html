The middle school branch of Tricode girls club is taught by Zaia,<BR>
using curriculum from the Girls Who Code franchise. Early lessons<BR>
will focus on computer programming basics before moving to lessons<BR>
on cybersecurity, python, html and css based web pages, and eventually<BR>
cover cryptography and ethical hacking. Each individual girl will gain<BR>
a number of computer skills as well as have access to our small library
of books about coding and stories of historical women in stem<BR>.
