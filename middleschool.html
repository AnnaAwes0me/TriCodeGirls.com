<h3> Classes </h3>
<p>
During the course of Tricode girls club middle school girls will work<BR>
and learn together as we explore lessons in cryptography, programming,<BR>
web design, and hacking. Tricode girls also offers a small library of<BR>
books on coding or famous historical women in STEM. We also have some<BR>
“library computers” that we loan out to girls who don’t have a computer<BR>
to use for our classes. We hope to encourage girls to think outside<BR>
of the box and pursue interests in otherwise male dominated fields.<BR>
