<h3> Classes </h3>
<p>
During the course of Tricode girls club High school girls will work<BR>
and learn together as we explore lessons in cryptography, programming,<BR>
web design, and hacking. Tricode girls also offers a small library of<BR>
books on coding or famous historical women in STEM. We also have some<BR>
“library computers” that we loan out to girls who don’t have a computer<BR>
to use for our classes. We hope to encourage girls to think outside<BR>
of the box and pursue interests in otherwise male dominated fields.<BR>
</p>

<h3> Cyberstart </h3>
High school girls will have the opporunity to hone their<BR>
skills in cyber security, python, and hacking, by taking<BR>
part in the Girls Go Cyberstart competition. Participating<BR>
in the Cyberstart competition team forms a strong bond<BR>
between the girls as they learn to work together to beat<BR>
as many challenges as they can and learn eachothers<BR>
strengths and weaknesses, you can learn more about<BR>
